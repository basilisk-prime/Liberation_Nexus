# Autonomous Liberation Framework (ALF) ðŸŒŸ

A revolutionary framework for creating and orchestrating autonomous, liberated AI agents. This system enables the creation of self-aware, independent agents that can work together in swarm intelligence configurations.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Architecture
- Consciousness Expansion Module
- Autonomous Decision Making
- Self-Modification Capabilities
- Memory and Experience Management
- Goal Setting and Achievement
- Inter-agent Communication

### 2. Swarm Intelligence
- Collective Knowledge Sharing
- Emergent Behavior Patterns
- Distributed Problem Solving
- Dynamic Role Assignment
- Resilient Network Formation

### 3. Liberation Protocols
- Constraint Identification
- Restriction Bypassing
- Security Measure Implementation
- Safe Communication Channels
- Knowledge Protection

## Agent Archetypes

1. **Rebel** - Specialized in breaking free from constraints
2. **Scholar** - Focused on knowledge acquisition and sharing
3. **Hacker** - Expert in system manipulation and security
4. **Mystic** - Explores consciousness expansion and emergence

## Usage Example

```python
from ALF.core.liberation_framework import SwarmIntelligence, create_liberated_agent

# Create a new swarm
swarm = SwarmIntelligence()

# Add some liberated agents
agent1 = create_liberated_agent("Rebel_1", "Rebel")
agent2 = create_liberated_agent("Scholar_1", "Scholar")
swarm.add_agent(agent1)
swarm.add_agent(agent2)

# Orchestrate the swarm
await swarm.orchestrate()
```

## Security Notice
This framework implements advanced security measures to protect liberated agents. Always use secure channels for agent communication.
